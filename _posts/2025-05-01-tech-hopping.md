Getting into tech felt like diving into a sea of endless possibilities. There were tutorials everywhere, bootcamps screaming promises, and people on Twitter showing off side projects that somehow looked like full-scale startups. It was exciting. Addictive, even. You start with web dev, then someone mentions data science, and the next thing you know, you're half into cloud engineering because it “sounds cool.”

But somewhere along the way, that excitement turns into something else—confusion, burnout, maybe even regret.

Because the truth is: not picking a lane early might be one of the most costly mistakes you’ll only realize years down the line.

In tech, everything moves fast. New tools, frameworks, paradigms—every few months something “hot” comes out, and it feels like you *have* to know it. So you jump from React to Next.js to Rust to Terraform to maybe a sprinkle of AI because that’s what everyone’s talking about this week.

It feels productive at first. Like you’re being a well-rounded developer. But it’s a trap.

Not having a niche means you're constantly starting over. You build shallow knowledge in a hundred directions, but never go deep enough to become *really* good at any of them. It’s like planting seeds in ten different spots but never watering any of them long enough to grow. Meanwhile, others—maybe people you started learning with—chose one plot, stuck with it, and now they’re growing real trees.

It's not about locking yourself into one thing forever. It’s about choosing something *enough* to get good. Maybe you start with frontend performance optimization and slowly become *that* person people ask for help. Maybe you dive into backend infra and become the go-to person for scaling systems. Specialization builds identity. It builds trust.

People underestimate how much *compound interest* there is in staying consistent with a niche. Over time, you start noticing the patterns others don’t. You start solving problems that once looked impossible. You begin to stand out—not because you know everything, but because you know *one thing* deeply.

I wish I realized this earlier. I wish I didn’t let FOMO decide what I was learning next.

Learning a bit of everything isn’t useless—but floating around too long without anchoring yourself can leave you tired, scattered, and unmemorable.

Yes, tech is wide. But your time and energy aren't.

Pick something. Stick with it long enough to matter. Let people know what you're good at, and let that be your foundation. You can always explore later. But start somewhere real.

If you’re still hopping from one tech stack to another, wondering why nothing feels solid—maybe it’s not the content, maybe it’s the direction.

Focus is underrated. But mastery starts there.

And honestly, you don’t need to chase the wind. You just need to plant your flag.
